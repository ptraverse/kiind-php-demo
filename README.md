"Cash for Clicks" - B2C Marketing Idea

This project is a PHP rewrite of http://quidprize.com which was originally written in Python Django. It combines a gift-card disbursement service (<a href="https://www.kiind.me">Kiind.me</a>) with a shortlink/tracking service (<a href="http://ow.ly">Ow.ly</a> or <a href="http://goo.gl/">goo.gl</a>). 

The basic model is that a business creates a "Campaign" to drive clicks to their website by offering a prize such as a giftcard (to their own business!); users can participate in the campaign by generating trackable shortlinks; with each click the user generates within the campaign, they increase their chances of winning the prize.
